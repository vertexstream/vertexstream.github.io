This site it a blog about my adventures in Computer Graphics. My name is [John Ward](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wardjp/), and I am (at the moment) a sales person, but I have 15 years experience working as a Programmer, Technical Lead and Project Manager. Having completed a graphics course in the late 90s (As part of my degree), and working on a DirectX Windows graphics device driver project, I decided it was time to learn OpenGL.

So to start with this is my blog about learning the graphics API by writing my first game. The game I am going to right in C++ and OpenGL is a clone of Tetris called Quadrapassel (Quadrapassel3d), as I am the maintainer of [Quadrapassel](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Quadrapassel)
