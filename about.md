Welcome to the VertexStream project. This aim of this project is to so enable 3d objects to be viewed on mobile devices and web applications (websites) for the use in 3D Commerce, and for industrial use. The will proivide an open source reference back end framework that will server your 3d contents securely to any location. We will also privide the white label integration components for the client side, these are on web pages, and applications, such as iOS, Android, Qt and GTK+

In a nutshell, the aim of the VertexStream project is to do 3 things:

3D Commerce: Provide 3D Commerce solutions for deivering 3D objects to mobile apps and websites
GFX Tools: Provide Computer Graphics Tools to keep vertices flowing, for the greater good of Computer Graphics
Linux Stacks: Build modern computer graphics stacks for the use in industrial and automotive industries

## Services we provide:
Using our reference platform provide a mechanism to upload and deliver 3D content to client applications or websites
3D Scanning of small/medium size objects, i.e. for retail etc
Production of mobile apps and websites based on white label solutions
Vulkan and OpenGL development for further customisations
Microservice delivery mechanism in Rust
